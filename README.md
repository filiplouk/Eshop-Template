# Eshop-Template  

FAYS is a fashion eshop template with basic functionalities. It is made for development reasons only. Photos that are displayed derive from websites that provide
free images and so the products are not real.

FAYS is a good starting point for a developer who would like to design an eshop, to use it as template and alter it's components.
